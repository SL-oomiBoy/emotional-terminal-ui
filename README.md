## 🧠 About

**"ERROR 404: Relationship Not Found"** is a dramatic single-page web experience that tells a subtle story of trust lost, recovery, and emotional processing — all through a programmer’s lens. Designed to simulate a terminal session, the project walks users through a fictional system crash rooted in a betrayal, all while delivering visual storytelling using CSS, animations, and glitch aesthetics.

It’s not entirely a breakup page. It’s more about the *process* of realizing something broke, accepting it, and gently rebooting your system — solo.

## 📌 Author’s Note

This isn’t just a creative HTML experiment.  
It’s my personal story — written not to get attention, but to close a chapter.  
Sometimes we don’t need to speak out loud. We just need to render something that feels true.

> Built with pain. Deployed with peace.
